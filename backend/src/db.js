        content: '<p>The Boston Celtics hit a new stride after entering the year of 2022, boasting a defensive rating of 105.2 during that span, 6.8 points above league average. As well as an offensive rating of 117.9, which would place second in the league. As a result, Boston had a 34-12 record, bested only by the league-best Phoenix Suns and the Dallas Mavericks in the same stretch.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other hand, the Golden State Warriors stormed out of the regular season with an 18-2 record, thanks to defensive rating that was a whopping 8.8 points above league average, a mark tied for the best in NBA history. The season was unfortunately derailed by numerous injuries and the reintegration of Klay Thompson, and it will be unlikely to see the defense return to such historical levels due to the emergence of Jordan Poole and Klay Thompson’s regression as an elite wing defender. But on the other hand, the rise and return of the aforementioned two has done wonders for the offense, leading to a league best 116.1 offensive rating in the playoffs, a drastic change from the pedestrian 112.1 rating in the regular season.</p><p><br></p><p>The regular season matchups provide little information as neither team were playing at their top levels at that time. Injuries to multiple players in both side in previous series also changes the equation. It is best to begin by looking at the elephant in the room:</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Celtics Defense vs Warriors offense: </strong></p><p>By putting Marcus Smart in as the starting point guard, Boston is able to unlock switchable, big lineups with practically no exploitable weak points. Marcus Smart is the quintessential perimeter defender, Jayson Tatum is long and switchable, Al Horford remains versatile as a switch big in addition to providing rim protection. Robert Williams is an explosive and long paint defender, often sagging off non-shooters and roaming the inside. However, his knee injury has limited his minutes in the conference finals and lessened his defensive value, and it remains to be seen if his health improves in the following days. His presence, or lack thereof will be paramount to the Celtics chances.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Halfcourt Offense </strong></p><p>The Warriors offense is predicated on DHOs, split actions, guard screens...</p><p>Its kryptonite? A physical, switching defense. Teams like the 2016 Thunder and the 2018 Rockets employed such strategies, forcing Golden State to resort to isolation heavy styles, a recipe for disaster against a Boston team loaded with elite wing defenders.</p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(30, 30, 30);">Per Second Spectrum, the Celtics switched the most on-ball actions per 100 </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(30, 30, 30);">possessions (28.8) during the regular season. Boston found success playing drop </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(30, 30, 30);">coverage in the pick and roll during the Miami series.

Golden State just happen to have the two best shooters in the world, but </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(30, 30, 30);">Boston guards are elite screen navigators, and in an attempt to force golden state off </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(30, 30, 30);">the line, creates mid-range opportunities for the Warriors.

Expect that </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(30, 30, 30);">number to go up. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(30, 30, 30);">To shed more light into the problem that is the Warriors halfcourt offense, one can look </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(30, 30, 30);">into games 4-6 of the Memphis series, against what is equivalently the best defense in </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(30, 30, 30);">the league. The Warriors created advantage through simple high pick-and-rolls. With </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(30, 30, 30);">Green as the screener and involving the hobbled and less mobile Williams to either </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(30, 30, 30);">switch or blitz the ball handler creates 4 on 3 opportunities or mismatches. In addition, </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(30, 30, 30);">dragging Williams out to the three-point line opens up the paint for rim attacks and </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(30, 30, 30);">backdoor cuts (By the same reasoning, DHOs to Curry or Poole is also a viable option </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(30, 30, 30);">in eliminating Celtics’ rim protection.). </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(30, 30, 30);">The Celtics can counter this by putting Williams III on Wiggins, something Denver tried with Jokic in the first round. Wiggins is less active </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(30, 30, 30);">as an off-ball screener than Looney or Green, and the Warriors rarely rely on him to go </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(30, 30, 30);">1 on 1. Tatum on Green can also eliminate the Curry-Green pick and roll by switching. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(30, 30, 30);">Stephen Curry is averaging a healthy 1.14 points per possession (82nd percentile) on </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(30, 30, 30);">isolations in these playoffs and should have no problems getting past Celtics bigs in </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(30, 30, 30);">mismatch situations, but the Warriors will need to find more offense other than Curry’s </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(30, 30, 30);">shot creation. Jordan Poole was excellent in the second regular season meeting, </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(30, 30, 30);">scoring 29 points and picking apart the Celtics defense. A steady dose of well-timed </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(30, 30, 30);">cuts and slipped screens can also be useful in creating defensive breakdowns. </span></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Transition offense </strong></p><p>In the six Boston losses, they averaged 16.3 turnover per game. Miami defenders were able to contain dribble penetration by aggressive reaching for the ball. Celtics ball handlers, namely Tatum and Brown, are loose with their handles and mistake-prone. Warriors defenders like Green, Wiggins, and eventually Payton II and Iguodala are more than capable of forcing turnovers and turning them into efficient offense on the other end. The Warriors are as turnover-prone (if not more) as Boston. When faced with a disruptive Memphis defense, couldn’t stop throwing the ball into the second row every other possession. The Celtics play a slightly different defensive style, but the point has been made. Winning the turnover battle will prove critical in the outcome of the series.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Second chance points </strong></p><p>Andrew Wiggins and Kevon Looney led the playoffs for most offensive rebounds with 42. The Warriors have outrebounded opponents in 9 of the last 11 games. Celtics have rebounding big men like Horford and Williams III, but posted a mediocre 71.2 defensive rebounding rate (10th overall) in the playoffs. The possession battle will be as important as the turnover battle and is a source of easy offense for the Warriors.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>X-factor: Draymond Green </strong></p><p>Draymond Green has been at the peak of his defensive powers in these playoffs. But at times he has been hesitant and turnover-prone on offense. He had his best game of the playoffs in game 5 against Dallas, scoring 17 points and dishing out 9 assists. Golden State will need him to push the tempo whenever possible and limit his turnovers. Playing off-ball as a screener and roller has proven to be most successful. He must also be aggressive looking to score instead of forcing passes through tight or non-existent windows. A three-pointer every now and then wouldn’t hurt, Warriors are 19-1 when Green hits a three.</p><p><br></p><p>The Warriors experimented with Green on Damian Lillard and Chris Paul in the regular season. Green was able to block off passing lanes with his wingspan and navigate screens well, making life hell for the two guards. Most importantly, neither were very active off the ball, which allows Green to still roam as a free safety on defense. The same treatment can be expected for Marcus Smart, who has been the Celtics’ main facilitator and has improved as a decision maker. Eliminating him from the equation forces the Boston duo to create on the ball more and thus impact their efficiency. Like putting Green on Jalen Brunson vs Dallas, Green on Brown is also an option. It limits Brown’s production and takes away one of Boston’s shot creator.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Celtics offense vs Warriors defense: </strong></p><p>The Celtics have an uninspiring 111.8 offensive rating in the playoffs. Against elite defenses in Milwaukee and Miami, that number dipped to 109.8 . The Warriors’ defensive gameplan should be simple: Force Tatum and Brown to create off the dribble in late clock situations, send aggressive help and dare Celtics non-shooters to shoot and contest with quick and in-sync rotations. This is where Derrick White’s shot making becomes important. He is hitting an awful 25 percent of his threes in these playoffs. He must be able to punish Warriors defenders for sagging off him. The same goes for Marcus Smart, who has questionable shot selection and has been shooting 23.1 percent from three after his injury.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Preventing Mismatches </strong></p><p>Boston was aggressive hunting Miami’s Tyler Herro and Gabe Vincent with their dynamic duo in the ECF. Expect the same for Stephen Curry and Jordan Poole. Curry has been excellent defensively in the playoffs, but it remains to be seen if Poole’s offensive output can offset his defensive limitations. The Warriors have had plenty of practice on mismatch hunting against Luka Doncic in the conference finals. The most common coverage is a hard hedge, where the defender jumps out on the ball handler before recovering to the screener. Dallas countered this by flipping the screen or have the screener pick and pop. Fortunately for the Warriors, Celtics guards are poor/inconsistent shooters and shouldn’t pose much of a threat as a popper. Pre- switching a better defender on the screener is also commonly employed. Creating mismatches is a time-consuming task, and the Warriors like to send doubles in late clock situations and recover to the weak side on skip passes.</p><p><br></p><p>The Warriors commonly throw out multiple defensive schemes in an attempt to confuse the offense. Playing zone every now and then against a Celtics team who scored 0.901 PPP against the zone in the regular season would be a good idea. An unconventional triangle and 2 defense with man-to-man defense on Tatum and Brown while the remaining three zone up can be useful as well.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Defending Jayson Tatum </strong></p><p>Jayson Tatum has been unstoppable in these playoffs, 27-7-6 while shooting 50 percent from two and nearly 38 percent from three. But his mid-range shooting has been subpar, he is shooting 35.9 percent on pullup mid-rangers in the postseason. So forcing Tatum off the line by going over the screen and push him into taking mid-range jumpers</p><p>and floaters would the formula here. Tatum also has the tendency to pullup when going left, so shading him to his off hand will be the way to go.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Health and fatigue: </strong></p><p>The Celtics are coming off back-to-back 7-game series and run a tight 7-man rotation in the playoffs. Tatum and Brown are averaging 41.0 and 38.2 minute per game respectively. The Warriors finished Dallas in 5 and have a 3 day rest advantage. That’s 3 less flights and 2 less games. On the other hand, Golden State have Otto Porter, GPII, and Iguodala recovering from injuries. Porter is an important bench piece, shooting the ball well, playing defense, and is an elite rebounder. Gary Payton II on Brown would create chaos. On offense, he cuts well and is an underrated finisher. Iguodala is another good defender to throw at Boston wings and commands the floor when Curry and Green is off the floor. The Warriors motion offense is exhausting to defend. Multiple rest days before 6 of the 7 games benefits both teams. But if the series goes deep, expect Boston to run out of gas before the Warriors, which would mean more defensive breakdowns and shots hitting front rim.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Prediction: </strong></p><p>Home court advantage matters, Warriors are yet to lose at home, But Boston is 7-2 on the road. Celtics have been vulnerable at home, losing 4 games, Warriors have won a road game in 26 consecutive series, an NBA record. Warriors have the advantage in terms of finals experience, 123-0 in games played. Celtics matches up the Warriors better than any other team with their historical defense and individual brilliance, but the talent, depth disparity, and most importantly, the experienced championship core of <span style="color: rgb(30, 30, 30);">Curry, Thompson, and Green will be too much to overcome. </span></p><p><br></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(30, 30, 30);">Warriors in 7.&nbsp;</strong></p>'

He nailed all three from the stripe, moments after missing a pair that would’ve pulled Utah within two.</p><p><br></p><p>Victor Oladipo was fouled, and split for Miami, who somehow managed to foul Lauri Markkanen while he attempted a game-tying 3 from the right wing.&nbsp;<em>He&nbsp;</em>then sank all three free throws, setting up the fateful, final possession with 6.3 seconds to go.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>DIFFICULTY:</strong>&nbsp;Herro took the inbounds and nearly got pinned in the backcourt along the right sideline. A behind-the-back dribble cleared enough room to advance up the middle. With Clarkson on his hip, Herro skip-stepped across midcourt, right into a runner from just behind the line as Mike Conley swiped without committing enough to risk the foul. Markkanen similarly contested while backing up, allowing ample space for Herro’s clean release. The shot rattled right on home as the backboard light signaled there would be no overtime.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>CELEBRATION:</strong>&nbsp;Herro started backing away while watching the shot drop, always a good look just in case because it makes it seem you knew and were just waiting for confirmation. His momentum carried him right toward awaiting Heat teammates. He spun-jumped into the crowd as the hyped shoves ping-ponged him around.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>GRADE:</strong>&nbsp;Racing the length of the court, nearly losing possession, shooting on the move between three opponents, and avoiding overtime on New Year’s Eve? That’s Tyler playing Herro.&nbsp;<strong>4&nbsp;Horrys.</strong></p>',
